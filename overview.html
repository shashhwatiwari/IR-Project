        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>Our team project involves using a breached phone number dataset to locate where the phone numbers have been leaked to. To achieve this, we will be applying a range of information retrieval techniques, including data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. These techniques will help us extract and classify the relevant data based on the phone number's location. Throughout the project, we may encounter technical terms such as indexing, querying, ranking, and relevance to aid in our search process.</p>

        <h1>Website Development</h1>
        <p>To present our findings, we plan to create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML will help us structure the website's content, CSS will provide an appealing design, and JavaScript will add interactive features and functionality to the site. Additionally, we will use a server-side programming language such as PHP to manage the website's backend functionality.</p>

        <h1>Information Retrieval Techniques</h1>
        <p>Throughout the project, we will be implementing various information retrieval techniques to locate where breached phone numbers have been leaked to. These techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data mining</li>
          <li>Natural language processing</li>
          <li>Machine learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By applying these techniques, we will be able to extract and classify relevant data based on the phone number's location. We may also encounter technical terms such as indexing, querying, ranking, and relevance throughout the process.</p>
